## HTML assignment
**Due:** Friday, Febuary 16, 3 p.m.


### Instructions

This projects is worth **15 points.**

Create a web-based version of your résumé using valid HTML5. It should be the equivalent of about 1 - 1 1/2 pages.

You have the freedom to be creative in how you present your résumé. It should take into account which part(s) of your details are the most important content-wise, be marked up in a way which describes the content and organized using HTML5 structural tags.

**Suggestion:** Follow instructions. When you finish your first attempt at coding, print this page and mark off each requirement you have met. Then fix your code/résumé to meet the requirements you have missed.


### Before You Begin

Your résumé is a reflection of you. What you post to the web can be seen by anyone.

If you have not created a résumé or need advice creating an effective one, meet with an advisor. [Toppel Career Center](http://www.sa.miami.edu/toppel/) (5225 Ponce De Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, Fla.) offers walk-in résumé advising, Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Appointments are also available.

### Requirements

Your web pages should:

- Be written in valid HTML5
- Use HTML5 structural tags -- header, nav, main, section, article -- (footer only if necessary)
- Properly use heading (h1-h6) tags
- Use appropriate tags for marking up respective content
- Avoid use of decorative characters (i.e. hand-coded bullets (•), pipes (|), etc.)
- Exclude presentational elements (i.e. b, i, hr, br, etc.)
- Exclude generic tags (i.e. span, div)
- Exclude any styling
- Include at least two external links
- Follow best practices
- Be free of spelling, grammatical and style errors
- Be free of broken links
- Be free of broken images


#### Optional

You may include an image or photo, but it is not required. If you choose to include a photo or graphics (social media icons, for instance):

- you must have the rights to use it
- it must be included in your GitHub repo (do not 'hot link' to an image or file hosted on another web site)


### Submission

Only one file — `resume.html` — is required for this assignment.

Commit your résumé as resume.html to the username.github.io repository you created in [exercise-05](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/exercise-05) during class. (You *do not* need to create a new repository for every project; always submit to the repository you added your first ever web page to.)

Create an [issue in this repository](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/html/issues) with your full name and a link to your web page (http://username.github.io/resume.html) by the deadline.

If you are unsure of what is required in the issue, [check the example](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/html/issues/1) provided.

Do not wait until the last minute to submit your URL.


### Grading

You are expected to do your best to meet the requirements listed above. If you give an honest effort and submit the work on time, you will receive full credit.

To assure you do not make mistakes going forward, your professor will provide feedback regarding missing requirements. One-on-one help will also be available to go over any questions you may have to improve the quality of your work moving forward. Missing requirements and/or mistakes will not be overlooked on future assignments.

**You are, however, required to submit this assignment properly and on time.** A missed deadline (submitting the assignment at 3:00:01 p.m.) will result in a two (2) point deduction for every 24-hour period the assignment is late.

Failure to submit the assignment to GitHub as detailed above (to your `username.github.io` repo, as `resume.html`) will result in a two (2) point deduction.

(I use a computer script to clone and do an initial check of every student's work. If the script breaks, it means I have to do extra work to find and/or grade your assignment. Therefore, it will cost you in points.)

**Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council.**

Good luck!
